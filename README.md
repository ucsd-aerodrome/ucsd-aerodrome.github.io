## Contact Form 
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It cannot execute server-side scripts like the ones written in PHP, Python, or Ruby. To enable functionality like contact forms on a GitHub Pages, we use third-party form submission services like ```Formspree```. These services provide a straightforward solution to handle form submissions without the need for server-side scripting.
